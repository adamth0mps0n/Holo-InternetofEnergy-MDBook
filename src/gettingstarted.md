# Getting Started

## Who should read this book?
Business people, Developers, Tinkerers are all accommodated in this book.
Basically it is written for any person who has an idea, concept or desire to build an application that will control, manage or interact with an energy consuming/producing/or storing device, or a community of them.

Some development experience is an advantage but the book aims to provide a step by step guide that developers and non developers can follow.

## Knowledge pre-requisites
Again some knowledge of RUST and Holochain is desirable but not essential.

## Setup pre-requisites
The coding components of the book require that you have Holochain running on your system.
Instructions for setting up are found here:
