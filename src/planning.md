# Planning to Build and IoE

There are three types of use cases that readers may be interested in here:

1 - You have an energy consuming/storing/generating device or product that you wish to enable.

2 - You already have a device or community of devices and wish to build an application for them on the platform.

3 - You may wish to build a FE Interface or Integration to an existing Device or Application.

This book provides guidance for all these scenarios.
