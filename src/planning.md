# Planning to Build and IoE

There are three types of use cases that readers may be interested in here:

- You have an energy consuming/storing/generating device or product that you wish to enable.
- You already have a device or community of devices and wish to build an application for them on the platform.
- You may wish to build a FE Interface or Integration to an existing Device or Application.

This book provides guidance for all these scenarios.

In addition to the use cases above it is also worth noting that the IoE protocol need not only be limited to energy use cases.  In fact the IoE service can be applied to any IoT device in order to enable it to be discovered and discover devices around it and communicate using a common language.  With that in mind it could potentially be used by any IoT device to orchestrate and organise securely, privately and at scale.
