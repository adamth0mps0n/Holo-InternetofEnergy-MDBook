## Cryptographic Autonomy License

The Holochain community are currently developing a new license that will be called the ['Cryptographic Autonomy License'](https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/why-we-need-a-new-open-source-license-c8faf8a8dadd).
This model will address the unique needs of truly peer-to-peer software models that are currently not addressed by GPLv3 or other license mechanisms available.

The IoE will likely leverage this structure when it becomes available.
