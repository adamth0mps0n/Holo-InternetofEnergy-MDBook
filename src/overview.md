# Overview
the IoE is built on Holochain.  Holochain is a pattern for truly distributed peer to peer applications.
In addition IoE Applications are hosted on the 'Holo' service which is a distributed hosting platform built upon the Holochain architecture.

Holochain was selected as it is; lightweight, fast, scalable, requires no consensus, or energy hungry mining.  Much more than that though, we selected Holochain because of its 'agent based' architecture which gives it significant advantages over centralised or existing blockchain distributed solutions.

An intelligent energy system requires adaptability and nuance at the network edges.  Blockchain and centralised solutions cannot and will not address this need.

The agent based model differs from other architectures as it allows devices to;
- tailor their behaviour/reactions to their specific circumstances
- choose to share or not share private data about their circumstances
- create and apply a unique 'agent' perspective on the community and situation.
- it is fractal in the sense that agents can form and interact in direct peer to peer relationships and communities dynamically
- it is anti fragile in that it grows stronger rather than weaker with scale and complexity
- in addition it provides all the same features and benefits of traditional blockchain with none of the constraints.

The IoE in alignment with Holochain is written first in the Rust language.
Rust is a great language for IoT and is great for producing secure and robust code.
