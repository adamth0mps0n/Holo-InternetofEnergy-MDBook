# Let's build a smart plug
This section provides a step by step guide to building a 'smart plug' that will leverage the Internet of Energy and a 'market demand management app' to react to peaks in the external market.

When the external market price is 'peaking' the plug will switch off for that peak period.
The app has a front end so the user can set the 'peak' value at which this behaviour occurs.. (i.e. 20% over average price, 30%...).

As well as the user helping grid stability through this app the running of this plug will also begin to 'earn' the user ***IoECURRENCY*** .
