# Grammar and Currency

## objective

this sets the rules for interactions, between devices, between users, between communities, and any combination of the above.
for m2m communications on the IoE one big challenge will be trust of the interactions... we need to create a framework that ensures as much as possible that what one agent is telling another is true, and if it is found not to be what are the consequences.

beyond that this section also sets up a 'currency' standard for value transactions that aims to create a flow to create the following:
- a currency that enables energy to be traded p2p m2m across device, product, brand, providers, and geographies.
- a model that rewards local clean community based energy givers and efficient users
- a model that rewards those who give clean energy in a way that helps 'prop' up, support and enhance the ability for those who want to transform to clean energy but lack the resources.
- a model that discourages dirty energy sources

## currency design Architecture

- base currency 'mutual credit' kWh
- participants:
  - generators (solar systems, wind farms, etc)
    - they are the issuers and create tokens into existence
    - they can also include dirty energy producers
    - there needs to be a reputation and some specific attributes tied to the currency created .. i.e is it from a dirty source, clean, is it locally shared/shareable..??
  - consumers (ac's, pool pumps, any device)
    - they are the ones who consume the tokens.. they can set their rules for consumption.. i.e. clean only etc.
  - storers (batteries, ev's)
    - may or may not be another class but they do have some unique power to alter flows by slowing down or changing the demand/supply dynamic to benefit or disadvantage the system.
  - operators (poles and wires operators)
    - they monitor the system.. they are like the nanny watching over it.
    - they provide a service that keeps us all safe so need some sort of reward build in.
  - humans
    - the humans need to be rewarded for good energy behaviour..
    - they need to be able to reflect their energy 'principles and values' through their devices and those views need to be visible to their communities.
    - they need to be able to 'off-ramp' easily into traditional world (cash out) etc.

we should try to map the design to the design of Holofuel as it is the same in many ways.

## to do:

- list unique characteristics of the energy flow and needs
- then map a currency approach (token, reputation, incentive, etc) to address each in design
- build it.
