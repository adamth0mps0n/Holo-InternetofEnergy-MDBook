# Getting Started

## Who should read this book?
Business people, Developers, Tinkerers are all accommodated in this book.
Basically it is written for any person who has an idea, concept or desire to build an application that wants to control, manage or interact with an energy consuming/producing/or storing device, or a community of them.

Some development experience is an advantage but the book aims to provide a step by step guide that developers and non developers alike can follow.

## Knowledge pre-requisites
Again some knowledge of RUST and Holochain is desirable but not essential.

## Setup pre-requisites
The coding components of the book require that you have Holochain running on your system.
Instructions for setting up are found here:

## Following this book
The book is structured to first provide an overview both conceptual components and technical configuration options within the IoE.
Lower level details will be found in API documentation portals separately.

The first sections aim to provide a baseline understanding to get you going, but for the more adventurous there is also a section 6 at the end which provides a way to get your hands dirty through a sample project which builds a 'smart power plug'.
